## 📘 Project Overview

This project was developed as part of a university midterm challenge and is focused on mastering **core Python programming concepts** and implementing a **K-Means clustering algorithm** from scratch, without relying on third-party libraries like NumPy or scikit-learn.

The assignment is split into two major parts:
- **Python Fundamentals**: Exercises covering variables, data structures, loops, functions, and basic algorithms.
- **Unsupervised Machine Learning**: A complete K-Means clustering implementation using only the Python Standard Library.

> 🚫 **No external libraries (e.g., NumPy, pandas, scikit-learn)** were used—everything is written using pure Python.

---

## ✨ Highlights

- Wrote reusable functions for:
  - Calculating Euclidean distance
  - Initializing random centroids
  - Assigning clusters
  - Updating centroids iteratively
- Implemented a full K-Means clustering loop until convergence
- Solved foundational Python problems using loops, conditionals, and lists
